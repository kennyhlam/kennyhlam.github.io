          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I graduated from MIT in 2013 with my B.S. in Physics and Computer Science, and then again in 2014 with my M.Eng in Computer Science. Nowadays, I'm mostly interested in distributed systems/algorithms, machine learning, and applications to investing.</p>
          <p>Aside from technical interests, I really enjoy photography, biking, basketball, frisbee, and rock climbing. I also think it's very important to help out in your community and I try to help out with important <a href="http://campkesem.org/mit">causes</a> whenever I can.</p>
          <p>The easiest way to reach me is always via email at kenny dot h dot lam at g mail dot com.</p>
